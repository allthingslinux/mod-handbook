# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 Welcome to the Team
Before we jump into the details of this handbook, a big *thank you* for stepping up as a moderator!

We're excited to have you as part of the team and can’t wait to work alongside you to keep making this space awesome for everyone.

## 1.2 The Chain of Command
In All Things Linux, the chain of command is structured as follows:

1. **Owner**: The ultimate decision-maker who oversees the entire community and its operations.
2. **Administrators**: Responsible for managing the server, implementing policies, and supporting moderators in their roles.
3. **Moderator Director**: The head of the moderation team, responsible for training, support, and ensuring the effective implementation of moderation policies.
4. **Senior Moderators**: Experienced moderators who take on additional responsibilities, such as handling escalated issues and providing guidance to other moderators.
5. **Moderators**: The frontline team that actively engages with the community, enforces rules, and addresses member concerns.
6. **Junior Moderators**: Newer members of the moderation team who are learning the ropes and assisting moderators in their duties.

We want to make it clear that every voice on our staff team matters! While we have a chain of command, our internal chats are pretty laid-back. We encourage everyone to toss out suggestions and share fresh ideas, no matter their role. You’ll quickly see that we’re a friendly and open team, always ready to hear your thoughts and ideas, no matter where you fit in.

## 1.3 The Community
Our community is a lively hub for Linux and tech enthusiasts. We’ve got folks from every corner of the Linux world: curious newcomers just getting their feet wet, seasoned veterans, and everyone in between. What brings us all together? A shared love for Linux and technology, and the thrill of constantly learning and sharing what we know.

**What we value most**
Our conversations are all about tech. We love to chat about distributions, troubleshooting, custom scripts, security setups, the coolest open-source tools, or whatever new thing the FOSS world has stirred up. **The key is quality.** We want our main chats to be places where people can pick up valuable knowledge or share meaningful experiences. So, while jokes, memes, or non-tech off-topic chatter can be fun, we like to keep them minimal in our main spaces. There are other channels for that.

**Fast-Paced and Always Evolving**
We’re not a stale, stuck-in-the-mud community. We’re fast-paced and flexible, always open to trying new things. We experiment with new channels, content types, and ways to keep people participating, learning, and enjoying themselves. Trial and error are part of our DNA. Sometimes things work out, sometimes they don’t—and that’s okay! We adjust as we go and aim to learn from each experiment.

As a moderator, you’ll notice that the community’s needs and trends can change quickly. What might work one week could need a tweak the next. Being adaptable and open to the community’s pulse will help us continue to grow and improve.

# 2. The Importance of Moderation
Moderation is what keeps our community safe, engaging and welcoming. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about moderating, from managing different types of messages to handling tough situations with confidence. But before we dive in, it’s important to remember that moderation should be rewarding, not draining. We want you to enjoy your role, and invest your valuable time in ways that genuinely interest you. **This is very important to us.**

## 2.1 The Role of a Moderator
By moderating, you’re not just enforcing rules—you’re shaping a space where members can have meaningful, positive experiences. Effective moderation builds trust and encourages healthy interaction. 

You are here to:

- **Uphold standards**: set and enforce guidelines to ensure the community remains healthy and positive.
- **Maintain order**: manage discussions, and redirect conversations that veer off track.
- **Mediate conflicts**: step in to resolve disputes and misunderstandings, creating a balanced space.
- **Protect the Community**: address spam, inappropriate content, misinformation, and other threats to our community environment.

You are **not** here to:

- **Abuse your powers**: the tools at your disposal are here to maintain order, not to silence people you disagree with or to enforce bias.
- **Engage in personal vendettas**: we expect you to be professional and impartial in your moderation.
- **Micro-manage every interaction**: It’s not your job to control every conversation or over-police minor issues.

Besides the above, try to be as approachable as possible. We want people to feel comfortable coming to you with their questions and concerns. You're here to be a helpful presence, not a distant enforcer.

## 2.2 The Importance of the Code of Conduct

We obviously don't expect you to have every single rule memorized, but having a general understanding of our code of conduct is essential. These guidelines provide a clear, consistent framework for decision-making and help keep us fair across the board.

Moderating isn't about using personal bias or enforcing your own personal views. it’s about enforcing the community rules as they’re written. When handling issues, especially those that aren't super urgent, take the time to reference the appropriate section of the code of conduct. This means when issuing warnings, mutes, or bans, include the specific rule number in your reason message. Doing so not only makes your actions transparent but also educates members about what behavior crossed the line and why it wasn’t acceptable.

Relying on the code of conduct ensures that moderation stays consistent, fair, and free from bias. It also gives members a better understanding of our standards, reducing confusion and having a sense of "accountability".

Let's talk a little more about accountability:

## 2.3 Accountability
While moderators generally have the discretion to manage situations as they see fit, it’s crucial that they remain transparent about their decisions. If in a staff discussion, we ask for clarification regarding a warning, mute, or ban, you should be ready to explain your actions and provide context. 

It’s important to remember that issuing warns, mutes, or bans should never be taken lightly or used as a joke. These actions can significantly impact a member’s experience, so they should be reserved for genuine violations of the code of conduct. While we trust our moderators to act independently without needing to seek consensus on every decision—since doing so can slow down the team—we also expect them to exercise that discretion responsibly.

A few example of when mod actions **shouldn't** be issued:
- **At a member's request**: If someone asks for a warning or mute, do not just issue it. Our cases system exists solely for actual violations of the code of conduct.
- **Without context**: If you don't have enough information to make a decision, err on the side of caution and don't take any action *yet*.
- **As a joke**: Moderation isn’t a game. Using warns, mutes, or bans humorously undermines the seriousness of these actions and can damage trust within the community.
