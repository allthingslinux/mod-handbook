# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 Welcome to the Team
Before we jump into the details of this handbook, a big *thank you* for stepping up as a moderator!

## 1.2 The Chain of Command
### 1.2 The Chain of Command
In All Things Linux, the chain of command is structured as follows:

1. **Owner**: The ultimate decision-maker who oversees the entire community and its operations.
2. **Administrators**: Responsible for managing the server, implementing policies, and supporting moderators in their roles.
3. **Moderator Director**: The head of the moderation team, responsible for training, support, and ensuring the effective implementation of moderation policies.
4. **Senior Moderators**: Experienced moderators who take on additional responsibilities, such as handling escalated issues and providing guidance to other moderators.
5. **Moderators**: The frontline team that actively engages with the community, enforces rules, and addresses member concerns.
6. **Junior Moderators**: Newer members of the moderation team who are learning the ropes and assisting moderators in their duties.

We want to make it clear that every voice on our staff team matters! While we have a chain of command, our internal chats are pretty laid-back. We encourage everyone to toss out suggestions and share fresh ideas, no matter their role. You’ll quickly see that we’re a friendly and open team, always ready to hear your thoughts and ideas, no matter where you fit in.

## 1.3 The Community
Our community is a lively hub for Linux and tech enthusiasts. We’ve got folks from every corner of the Linux world: curious newcomers just getting their feet wet, seasoned veterans, and everyone in between. What brings us all together? A shared love for Linux and technology, and the thrill of constantly learning and sharing what we know.

**What we value most**
Our conversations are all about tech. We love to chat about distributions, troubleshooting, custom scripts, security setups, the coolest open-source tools, or whatever new thing the FOSS world has stirred up. **The key is quality.** We want our main chats to be places where people can pick up valuable knowledge or share meaningful experiences. So, while jokes, memes, or non-tech off-topic chatter can be fun, we like to keep them minimal in our main spaces. There are other channels for that.

**Fast-Paced and Always Evolving**
We’re not a stale, stuck-in-the-mud community. We’re fast-paced and flexible, always open to trying new things. We experiment with new channels, content types, and ways to keep people participating, learning, and enjoying themselves. Trial and error are part of our DNA. Sometimes things work out, sometimes they don’t—and that’s okay! We adjust as we go and aim to learn from each experiment.

As a moderator, you’ll notice that the community’s needs and trends can change quickly. What might work one week could need a tweak the next. Being adaptable and open to the community’s pulse will help us continue to grow and improve.
