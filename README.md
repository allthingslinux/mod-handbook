# 1. Introduction
Welcome to "The Discord Moderator Manual". This comprehensive manual has been carefully thought out and crafted to guide you through the essentials of moderating a Discord server effectively. Whether you're new to moderation or have previous experience, this handbook will provide you with the necessary knowledge and tools to succeed in maintaining a positive and engaging community. Our goal is to ensure _consistency, professionalism, and fairness_ in our moderation approach. Thank you for taking the time to read this manual!

### 1.1 Importance of Moderator Training
Effective moderation is essential for creating safe, welcoming, and productive Discord Communities. A well-trained moderation team can help maintain order, mitigate disputes, and bring a sense of belonging to the community members. Furthermore, moderators serve as role models and ambassadors for the community, shaping its culture and setting the tone for interactions. By investing in moderator training, communities can enhance their resilience, responsiveness, and overall health, ultimately enriching the experiences of all who participate. Remember that your actions from this point onwards reflect on the _community_. Not just on you.

<br>

> First, You Must Read & Understand: https://github.com/allthingslinux/code-of-conduct <br>
> For further help, please contact a senior moderator or read past cases to learn more.


## Preface

### Recommendation for Junior moderators

If you have been recruited recently after passing the application process, despite previous training you may have received from other community's, it's typically recommended you spend some time reading or observing how standard & senior moderators approach issues for at least one week before managing your own ticket(s), to learn how they make decisions and resolve problems, even asking questions about anything you see that might be confusing can benefit you having previously seen how cases are dedicated to certain staff, inspected and concluded.

You will not be able to conclude your ticket(s) with removing the user unless asking a standard or senior moderator to remove them on your behalf, until you are promoted to standard moderator when you will gain the permission to ban members.
﻿
### Moderator collaboration

Overseeing a community of this size has the potential of being mentally straining, if you are feeling unsure about any case you can coordinate with other moderators to help in solving the scenario, they may be able to find answers you hadn't considered or solve certain areas of investigation in more detail, keep in mind that you can always rely on and consult other moderators for assistance, share insights, discuss challenging cases, or inquire the best approach to handling issues.
﻿
We have strict procedures of only one moderator for each ticket, if you have involvement or input with any ticket that is not your own please forward the information you have to the moderator in current claim of the ticket, this is for clear dedication of each case to each moderator and non conflicting decisions, however tickets can be formally transferred if that means escalation of the issue or another moderator is better prepared for the circumstance. 

### Consider other solutions 

All cases will require investigation, and finding the right conclusion will demand your attention until resolved, from when a ticket is claimed by an moderator to when it is closed. however always consider other solutions besides tickets to solve the issue, be aware of every tool at your disposal for solving problems: https://github.com/atl.mod-handbook. {stand in}

## Creating your Ticket.
Before creating or answering tickets, you should always make informed decisions to prevent punishing for incorrect reasons or potently removing a member for a misunderstanding, false evidence and paper doll arguments are not uncommon so it can be difficult to find according conclusions, make sure there are no discrepancy in your knowledge of the situation, gathering context and understanding background is essential.
<br>
<br>
﻿
### 1.1. Gather Context of the Situation & User(s). <br>
﻿
For selected any selected user(s), any discussion, indevidual message you identify, or brought to your attention as causeing an issue, be sure to undersand basic information such as:
* __Entire context: When the problem started, leading to the present.__
* __Their message history & behaviour indicated.__
* __Checking the audit & automod.__
* __Potential account designation for spam.__
* __Review all past wickbot cases & notes.__
﻿
Further detail
﻿
* __Entire context: When the problem started, leading to the present__ <br>
Context helps clarify meaning by providing additional details, circumstances, or conditions surrounding any particular event, statement, or piece of information. It ensures that we interpret things accurately and avoid misunderstandings.

* __Their message history & behaviour indicated__ <br>
Reviewing past messages from the user can clarify how they decide to behave, whether or not they are following the rules, being disruptive or showing decency, helping & contributing to the community by being a worthy member and having a positive influence on others and new members. If the behaviour indicated is mostly or only negative that is what we need to correct. 

* __Checking the audit & automod__ <br>
There can be detail hidden from messages being: edited or deleted, with your access to #privlog/audit & #privlog/automod, copying the account-id and pasting it into the searchbar can show recent edited/deleted messages sense wickbot mentions the account-id for every log, containing relevant context hiden from your view, make sure to look through at least five pages. <br>

* __Potential account designation for spam__ <br> there is always the potential of an account being desagnated for evasion or instigation and so on, with the server having high notability in the general public it attracts a numerous amount of NSFW, NSFL & doxxing or defamation raids but avoid jumping to conclusions based on your intuition, E.g: them having a profile picture of a cat or their overt passion of using kali linux. <br>

* __All past wickbot cases & notes__ <br>
Using wickbot within #mod-bots check all past cases of the user via these commands: <br>
`/cases view user:USERID` `/cases view case:CASEID` <br>
read attached notes for selected user via these commands below, for tracking verbal warnings or other info: <br>
`/notes view user:USERID` `/notes view note_id:NOTEID`
<br>
<br>

### 1.2. Refer to which Rule(s) are in violation.
[Open the official Code of Conduct](https://github.com/allthingslinux/code-of-conduct) and reference the issue(s) to any matching section and determin the severity of the offince: Severe, Medium, Or Mild.

Only when member's clealy outline behavior unacceptable under our code of conduct is it instructed to confront them, otherwise if their actions do not break the rules directly but bypass or continue to disrupt the community, using your better judgement you are still able to speak with user(s) with tickets to provide verbal warnings or solutions to personal issues.

After you have assessed the situation it's important to recognize patterns as every ticket is based on the user listening, if one section of the conduct has been violated three or more times it is safe to assume they will disregard further warnings or potential penalty, bans are expected at this stage.
<br>
<br>

### 1.3. Create the Ticket using Helperbot.

After you have selected which user(s) to speak with, make a ticket via: `/ticket`, this command will create a new ticket for staff to use, each time a ticket is created %wheel is notified with a ping. 

For managing and adding the user(s), you can utilize either of these commands: <br>
`/add user:USERID channel:#000`
`/remove user:USERID channel:#000`

The name set of the new ticket will be automatically set to the next iteration number of all other tickets that have been created, and it is advised against to change the name, because with numerous members having modified client's they will be able to see the name of the channel and which roles are allowed in, implying that if the existence of the ticket is to be kept private and the identity of the client anonymous, no descriptive information should be set as the name of the ticket in any circumstance.

Always claim your ticket before sending any messages, this will dedicate the case to yourself instead of other moderators and [list the ticket under your name]([https://helper.gg](https://panel.parent.gg/1/tickets)) for management to view for possible reason of promotion or study for improvement of the server.
<br>
<br>
﻿
### 1.4. Explain the issue and results because of it.
﻿
When explaining the relevant issue, it's important to formally explain the problem(s) they have caused  
there are points mandatory to articulate:
* __The Issue.__ <br> 
* __The Effect's.__ <br>
* __Conduct found in Violation.__
* __The Rule(s) broken & According penalty.__ 
* __Prompt to Correct the behavior/issue.__
﻿
Further detail:
﻿
* __The Issue__ <br> It's important to properly explain the issue first so the recipient can properly understand what they did wrong.
 
* __The Effect's__ <br> In a situation the user does not care for the rules, articulating the matter for the recipient in terms of why their actions cause problems in the first place, can express the issue very well, and If they decide to bring the matter of the case outside of the ticket, anyone reading wouldn't require prerequisite context to understand why the user had received the ticket.
﻿
* __Conduct found in Violation__ <br> Provide all relevant evidence for each violation; using message links, screen captures, moderation or audit logs, and any proof to display this.
﻿
* __The Rule(s) broken & According penalty__ <br> Directly inform them of the specific rule in violation and penalty, no need delay unless inquiry is needed to resolve the case. 

* __Prompt to Correct the behavior/issue__ <br> prompt them to correct their behavior or avoid repeating the issue, and inquire if the user objects any reason.
<br>
Standard format of confrontation we use: <br>
{unfinished}

Here's a template for each violation of the code of conduct.

__[1.1. SFW Policy](https://github.com/allthingslinux/code-of-conduct?tab=readme-ov-file#11-sfw-policy)__
{unfinished}  

{Always recite the rule's broken.}
{With new users: keep an open mind, they may not grasp our standards immediately.} <br>
{If you are discussing details with other moderators or staff it is important to ignore any personal connections and focus on what is best for everyone.}

If the user has a recent history of any cirtan infractions you cannot place faith in them of listening once more, in this case the next step is only to remove the user. 

After listening to the response from the user <br>

* __If their response has had influence: Mention whether positive or negative.__
<br>
<br>

### 1.5. Consider their response, Then provide Penalty Or Conclusion.
Consider their response sincerely, what the user says can disprove or potentaly indecate a misunderstanding. If they admit of their mistake, apologize, insist to improve their behavior, or articulate precisely what you had intended: You have the option of modifying the expected penalty, Reducing: Severe penality to Medium, Medium to mild, And Mild to adding a Note.

At the end of the discussion, when the user have stated the issue will not happen again or agree/comply to your request of the issue not repeating by stating "I Understand.", "Got it.", or in other words understand & accept: <br>
If you have declared a Verbal warning invoke the following command, then the ticket can now be closed with `/close`; <br>
```/notes add user:USERID msg:Violation of Rule[?.?]: Verbal warning```

If the Code of Conduct indecates for a diffrent penlty:
run the selected command inside the ticket for the user to observe. <br>
`/timeout add user:USERID duration:1-12h reason:Violation of Rule[?.?]: Reason` <br>
`/warn user:USERID reason:Violation of Rule[?.?]: Reason` <br>
`/ban add user:USERID reason:Violation of Rule[?.?]: Reason` <br>

Reasons should be brief and along the lines of:<br>
"Violation of Rule[?.?]: Reason"

After using the command confident the user has viewed, proceed with using `/close`

The reason you add will be used for future tickets to recognize prevalent issues with members, if any user refuses to listen more then twice within a short period the next step is to consider removal. <br>
* Optionally you can include multiple reasons by adding "& ?.?" inside the square brackets. <br>
* No need to say the name of the rule within the wick, only the digit. <br>
* No need to attach Images/Media with the command, The content will display to #mod for anyone to see, as this server does not hide when users receive penalty, reasons should be a brief intended not to cause shame. <br>
* No need to mention whether they declined listening to a mod or a member, Just the fact they declined.
<br>
<br>

## Answering for Tickets
When you receive a ping for any new ticket created by a member of the server, wait for them to explain or articulate the issue/request for the staff, provide them any amout of time they need to finish their sentence, only after the request have been stated and you can perceive the type of help they need is it suggested to claim the ticket, after reading the ticket if you feel it would be best for a senior moderator or admin to answer the ticket you can discuss further who you think would be suited for the case in staff channels. {not always is the report correct}
<br>
<br>
﻿
### 1.6. Member created Tickets
﻿
in the situation a user has created a ticket themselves to notify you of an existing problem, or they have a request from staff
{talk with other staff among yourself if needed}

if you confident you posses the ability called for, you can choose to resolve the case by claming the ticket   
<br>
<br>
### 1.7.
Step one
<br>
<br>
## Other info

### Miscellaneous

* In the event a case involves you and needs to be resolved: please contact or hand the case to another moderator one level above yourself and provide all relavent info, The situation & Your side.
* In the event of declaring yourself unable to fishish a ticket you claimed or encounter a problem you cannot solve, And you have already receved input from a senior moderator: you can request to transfer the ticket to any admin.
* If you're investing effort to improve consider reading past tickets by heading to https://helper.gg and signing in with your discord account.
* If the recipient of your ticket has chosen to not acknowledge the ticket with your ping to them for more than 1 hour and with certainty you have expected them to have responded by that time: state "If you choose to evade this Ticket you will be removed from the server." and await their response, If they have not acknowledged the ticket for 24-48 hours, It means they are unwilling to listen to your better word or any higher authority and the next step to conclude the ticket is to remove them for being uncooperative, with ban reason being "Violation of Rule[?.?]: Evading Tickets".
<br>

### Notice

Be aware, there's a difference between penalty as cause of member(s) breaking the rules & penalty of your own better judgment: I.E banning for reasons of being a troll account or suspicion of involvement in raiding. It is advised to provide penalty based on the official Code of Conduct and to overlook incidents that clearly do not break the rules, In order to avoid accusation moderator abuse.
